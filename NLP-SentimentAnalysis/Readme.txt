# NLP Sentiment Analysis Project

This project focuses on sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to analyze the sentiment of text data, determining whether it's positive, negative, or neutral.

## Overview

The project consists of the following main steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Data is collected through web scraping techniques. This involves gathering text data from various online sources.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Before analysis, the collected data undergoes preprocessing steps, including cleaning, processing, and vectorization. This ensures that the data is in a suitable format for analysis.

3. **Vectorization**: In order to process textual data, it's essential to convert it into numerical representations. This step involves techniques such as:
    - **Bag-of-Words (BoW)**: Represents text data as a sparse matrix where each row corresponds to a document, and each column corresponds to a unique word in the corpus.
    - **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Weights words based on their frequency in the document and across the entire corpus, providing a measure of their importance.
    - **Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)**: Dense vector representations of words learned from large text corpora, capturing semantic relationships between words.
    - **BERT Embeddings**: Context-aware word embeddings considering the entire input sentence, obtained from models like Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT).

4. **Modeling**: Once the text data is vectorized, it's ready for modeling. Various machine learning and deep learning models can be employed for sentiment analysis, including:
    - Naive Bayes
    - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
    - Transformers (e.g., BERT)

5. **Testing**: The models are tested using various evaluation metrics to assess their performance in sentiment classification.
