# Transfer Learning: EfficientNetB4 and MobileNetV2 - An MLOps Project

## Overview
This project showcases an MLOps approach to machine learning, focusing on the application of transfer learning using EfficientNetB4 and MobileNetV2 models. It covers the entire machine learning lifecycle, including data loading, augmentation, modeling, training, evaluation, and testing, with an emphasis on operational excellence and monitoring.

## MLOps Integration
This project is designed with MLOps principles in mind, ensuring that machine learning models are not only developed but also monitored, maintained, and improved continuously. It integrates Weights & Biases (wandb) for experiment tracking, model versioning, and performance monitoring, making it a comprehensive MLOps solution.
